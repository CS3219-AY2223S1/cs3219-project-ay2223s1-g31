## Setting up

1. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
2. Replace `<DB_LOCAL_URI>` with your mongodb connection string. If you are connecting to MongoDB locally, it might look something like `mongodb://localhost:27017/<db_name>`
3. Replace `<random_64_bytes_string>` with some random 64-byte hex string (can use online tool to generate)
